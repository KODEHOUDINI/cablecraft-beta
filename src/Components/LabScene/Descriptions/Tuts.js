    name: "Ethernet Cable (Cat6)",
    description:
      "An Ethernet cable, Cat6 to be precise. While there are categories before and after it, such as Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6a, Cat7, and Cat8, Cat6 remains the most popular choice due to its reliable performance and affordability. The shielded version of Cat6 (STP) provides additional protection against electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for environments with high levels of interference.",
    function:
      "Widely used in both residential and commercial networks, Cat6 shielded cables provide sufficient speed and bandwidth for most everyday networking needs, supporting speeds up to 10 Gbps over short distances. The shielding ensures superior performance and reliability in demanding environments, making them a versatile and dependable option for a variety of applications. Cat6 shielded cables are favored for their ability to handle high-speed networking environments without the higher costs associated with newer cable categories, ensuring they remain a top choice for many users.",

    name: "Cross-Web Separator",
    description:
      "The cross-web separator is a plastic structure found inside some Ethernet cables, particularly Cat6 and above.",
    function:
      "It separates the four twisted pairs, reducing crosstalk and maintaining signal integrity, especially at higher data transmission rates.",
  },
  // 7
  {
    name: "Twisted Pairs",
    description: "Inside an Ethernet cable, there are four pairs of wires twisted together.",
    function:
      "These twisted pairs reduce electromagnetic interference and crosstalk from neighboring pairs and external sources, ensuring a more stable and reliable signal transmission.",
